## Team name (Software Chasers)
As all members came to agreement, our team was named Software Chasers. Even though plenty of names were on the table, but this one grabbed all members‚Äô interest as it matches perfectly with our vibe doing the project. It‚Äôs common sense that knowing how to build web applications eases the process of doing this project, but the majority of our members are more familiar with java development. We realize that this would make things pretty challenging and harder to achieve, but we are the software chasers who thrive in such circumstances and there are no limits for how high we can fly with our knowledge. 

## Scrum team (None of us is as smart as all of us)
   * Behind every strong team, a successful leader our Scrum Master Majdy Sabra Scrum Master and Front-End developer
   * Israa Odeh Front End developer and Documenter 
   * Arzaq Deodar Data base programmer
   * Khalid jabr Data base programmer
   * Mayar Abdulkareem Back-End developer
   * Jenan Abualrub Back-End developer


## Our Vision
Among all the points we are to achieve, gaining the satisfaction of our customer is our number one priority.
* Near Vision:
Happygrades is a grading tool that universities can use to organize their grading methodology. The main use of this app is to mange assigning assignments and submitting solutions to be graded later.\
<br/><br>
* Future Vision:
Happygrades will be optimized in the future to involve features that enable students to register courses at the beginning of the semester and allow teachers to choose the courses they will be teaching.

## Our product backlog
[Our product backlog on Trello (Link)](https://trello.com/invite/b/Jyzsu5D2/96d743d7eab954ef17ee74219db5b602/software-project-workspace)

* Our rationale for building the backlog:

Our rationale of ordering the user stories in the documented order in Trello was to start with general and common user stories then digging into more specified user stories for each user of our system. We followed the concept of generalization then specification. So, we have ordered the user stories according to which interfaces will be displayed first for each user.

* Definition of ready for product backlog items.

## Team Relative size Estimating activity
* front End <br/><br>
majdy : On the other hand, I chose to work on the front-end. I‚Äôve built similar Java based projects previously, thus, I have a quite good background in designing front ends.
<br/><br>
Israa : I chose to work on the frontend due to having the required skills and knowing the details of colors‚Äô theories. 
<br/><br>
* BackEnd <br/><br>
Mayar : If every member finds the right way to use their strength points, the team will succeed. The Back-End connects both the front and the data base integrally. I‚Äôm a good coder, hence, this position is perfect for me.<br/><br>
Jenan : There‚Äôs a thrill in building the backend which resides from it being where convenient algorithms are made to manipulate data as required. Knowing my backend developing potentials; I‚Äôm definitely in the right spot.<br/><br>
* Database<br/><br>
Arzaq : Database represents the core of the system as it shows all relations clearly. I‚Äôm really good at analyzing systems so I‚Äôll be working on building a fully functional database.<br/><br>
Khalid : with the skills I‚Äôve gained over previous semesters, I‚Äôm very qualified to be working on the database.<br/><br>
